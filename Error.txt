The error message is telling you that the titlecase module is not installed. You previously tried to install it, but it failed due to missing dependencies. Let's fix it.

âœ… Step 1: Install python3.10-venv
You need to install the python3.10-venv package to be able to create a virtual environment.

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
âœ… Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Now, create a virtual environment inside your project folder.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv myenv
âœ… Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment with:

bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
You should see (myenv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

âœ… Step 4: Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel (Inside Virtual Environment)
bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools setuptools_scm wheel
âœ… Step 5: Install titlecase (Inside Virtual Environment)
bash
Copy code
pip install titlecase
âœ… Step 6: Run your script (Inside Virtual Environment)
bash
Copy code
python3 bot.py
This setup ensures that all packages are installed properly within a virtual environment, avoiding conflicts with system packages.
